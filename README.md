## Description

For this project, I created a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions that runs in the browser.

I learnt more about how Javascript and the DOM opens up a whole new realm of functionality when building websites. I learnt about how to save user inputs to local storage in order to retrieve them later. 

## Usage

The quiz has been deployed at: https://mariuml.github.io/coding-quiz/

Please follow the link to view the final version. Once on the landing page, click start quiz and you will be presented with a range of multiple choice questions to test your coding knowledge. 

You will have 75 seconds to answer all the questions.
